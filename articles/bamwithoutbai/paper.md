# Summary

*BAM* (*Binary Alignment/Map format* ) is a [standard](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) binary format for storing hight-troughtpout sequencing data [@pmid19505943]. *BAM* files are compressed using the *BGZF* format,  a compression format implemented on top of the standard gzip file format while allowing efficient random access to the BAM file for indexed queries. An associated Bam Index (*BAI*) achieves a fast retrieval of alignments overlapping a specified region without going through the whole alignment. This technology also works through HTTP, making it possible to fetch regions from remote BAM files. 

Some sequencing projects, like Encode[@pmid29126249], provide *BAM* files but don't provide the associated *BAI* files, making it difficult to retrieve some specific regions of the BAM files: users need to download the whole *BAM* file before filtering the overlaping reads with samtools. 

We wrote a progam named '*bamwithoutbai*' that peforms a binary search on a remote *BAM*: it sends a HTTP `Range-Request` at some point of the bam, tries to find the next *BGZF* block and uncompress the stream until it finds a valid *BAM* record. This operation is repeated until the region of interest is narrowed.

In our test, downloading and filtering a BAM with samtools takes about 17 minutes while it only takes 24 seconds using our software.

BamWithoutBai is a java program, it uses the 'java library for high throughput sequencing'[@htsjdk] as well as some code from Hadoop-Bam project[@pmid22302568]. , it's part of the 'jvarkit' package[@jvarkit] and is available under the MIT License at: [http://lindenb.github.io/jvarkit/BamWithoutBai.html](http://lindenb.github.io/jvarkit).
