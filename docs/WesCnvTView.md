## Compilation

### Requirements / Dependencies

* java [compiler SDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) (**NOT the old java 1.7 or 1.6**, not the new 1.9) and avoid OpenJdk, use the java from Oracle. Please check that this java is in the `${PATH}`. Setting JAVA_HOME is not enough : (e.g: https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/23 )
* GNU Make >= 3.81
* curl/wget
* git


### Download and Compile

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit.git"
$ cd jvarkit
$ make wescnvtview
```

The *.jar libraries are not included in the main jar file, [so you shouldn't move them](https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/15#issuecomment-140099011 ).
The required libraries will be downloaded and installed in the `dist` directory.

Experimental: you can also create a [fat jar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150811/) which contains classes from all the libraries, on which your project depends (it's bigger). Those fat-jar are generated by adding `standalone=yes` to the gnu make command, for example ` make wescnvtview standalone=yes`.

### edit 'local.mk' (optional)

The a file **local.mk** can be created edited to override/add some definitions.

For example it can be used to set the HTTP proxy:

```
http.proxy.host=your.host.com
http.proxy.port=124567
```

## Input

Input is a set of regions to observe. It can be a 

   * BED file
   * VCF File with SV
   * Some intervals 'contig:start-end'

Input can be read from stdin

```
find src/test/resources/ -type f -name "S*.bam" > bam.list

$  java -jar dist/wescnvtview.jar -l bam.list  -P "RF01:100-200"
