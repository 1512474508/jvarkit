**bedtools**: *a powerful toolset for genome arithmetic*
================================================================

Collectively, the **bedtools** utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools
for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. The most widely-used
tools enable *genome arithmetic*: that is, set theory on the genome.  For 
example, **bedtools** allows one to *intersect*, *merge*, *count*, *complement*,
and *shuffle* genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used 
genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF. 

While each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., 
*intersect* two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted
by combining multiple bedtools operations on the UNIX command line.

Brief example
=================
Let's imagine you have a BED file of ChiP-seq peaks from two different
experiments. You want to identify peaks that were observed in *both* experiments
(requiring 50% reciprocal overlap) and for those peaks, you want to find to 
find the closest, non-overlapping gene. Such an analysis could be conducted 
with two, relatively simple bedtools commands.

.. code-block:: bash

    # intersect the peaks from both experiments.
    # -f 0.50 combined with -r requires 50% reciprocal overlap between the 
    # peaks from each experiment.
    $ bedtools intersect -a exp1.bed -b exp2.bed -f 0.50 -r > both.bed
    
    # find the closest, non-overlapping gene for each interval where
    # both experiments had a peak
    # -io ignores overlapping intervals and returns only the closest, 
    # non-overlapping interval (in this case, genes)
    $ bedtools closest -a both.bed -b genes.bed -io > both.nearest.genes.txt

Contributors.
=====================================
As open-source software, BEDTools greatly benefits from contributions made by other developers and
users of the tools. We encourage and welcome suggestions, contributions and complaints. This is how
software matures, improves and stays on top of the needs of its user community. The Google Code
(GC) site maintains a list of individuals who have contributed either source code or useful ideas for
improving the tools. In the near future, we hope to maintain a source repository on the GC site in
order to facilitate further contributions. We are currently unable to do so because we use Git for
version control, which is not yet supported by GC.
