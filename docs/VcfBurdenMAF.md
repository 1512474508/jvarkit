Burden : MAF for Cases / Controls 


## Usage

```
Usage: vcfburdenmaf [options] Files
  Options:
    -gtf, --gtf, --gtFiltered
      [20180117] Ignore FILTERed **Genotype**
      Default: false
    -h, --help
      print help and exit
    --helpFormat
      What kind of help
      Possible Values: [usage, markdown, xml]

      (faster) 
      Default: false
    -lumpy-su-min, --lumpy-su-min
      [20180117] if variant identified as LUMPy-SV variant. This is the 
      minimal number of 'SU' to consider the genotype as a variant.
      Default: 1
    -maxMAF, --maxMAF
      if MAF of cases OR MAF of control is greater than maxMAF, the the FILTER 
      Column is Filled

      header.A pedigree is a text file delimited with tabs. No header. Columns 
      are (1) Family (2) Individual-ID (3) Father Id or '0' (4) Mother Id or 
      '0' (5) Sex : 1 male/2 female / 0 unknown (6) Status : 0 unaffected, 1 
      affected,-9 unknown
    --version
      print version and exit

## Compilation

### Requirements / Dependencies

* java [compiler SDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) (**NOT the old java 1.7 or 1.6**) and avoid OpenJdk, use the java from Oracle. Please check that this java is in the `${PATH}`. Setting JAVA_HOME is not enough : (e.g: https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/23 )
* GNU Make >= 3.81
* curl/wget
* git
* xsltproc http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html (tested with "libxml 20706, libxslt 10126 and libexslt 815")


### Download and Compile

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit.git"
$ cd jvarkit
$ make vcfburdenmaf
```

The *.jar libraries are not included in the main jar file, [so you shouldn't move them](https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/15#issuecomment-140099011 ).
The required libraries will be downloaded and installed in the `dist` directory.

Experimental: you can also create a [fat jar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150811/) which contains classes from all the libraries, on which your project depends (it's bigger). Those fat-jar are generated by adding `standalone=yes` to the gnu make command, for example ` make vcfburdenmaf standalone=yes`.

### edit 'local.mk' (optional)

The a file **local.mk** can be created edited to override/add some definitions.

For example it can be used to set the HTTP proxy:

```
http.proxy.host=your.host.com
http.proxy.port=124567
```
