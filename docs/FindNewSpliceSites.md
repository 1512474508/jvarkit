# FindNewSpliceSites

![Last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/lindenb/jvarkit.png)

use the 'N' operator in the cigar string to find unknown splice sites


## Usage

```
Usage: findnewsplicesites [options] Files
  Options:
    --bamcompression
      Compression Level.
      Default: 5
    -h, --help
      print help and exit
    --helpFormat
      What kind of help
      Possible Values: [usage, markdown, xml]
    -out, --out
      Output file. Optional . Default: stdout
    --samoutputformat
      Sam output format.
      Default: SAM
      Possible Values: [BAM, SAM, CRAM]
    --version
      print version and exit
    -d
      max distance between known splice site and cigar end
      Default: 10
    -k
      UCSC knownGene File/URL. The knowGene format is a compact alternative to 
      GFF/GTF because one transcript is described using only one line.	Beware 
      chromosome names are formatted the same as your REFERENCE. A typical 
      KnownGene file is 
      http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/knownGene.txt.gz 
      .If you only have a gff file, you can try to generate a knownGene file 
      with [http://lindenb.github.io/jvarkit/Gff2KnownGene.html](http://lindenb.github.io/jvarkit/Gff2KnownGene.html)
      Default: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/knownGene.txt.gz

## Keywords

 * rnaseq
 * splice


## Compilation

### Requirements / Dependencies

* java [compiler SDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/). Please check that this java is in the `${PATH}`. Setting JAVA_HOME is not enough : (e.g: https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/23 )
* GNU Make >= 3.81
* curl/wget
* git


### Download and Compile

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit.git"
$ cd jvarkit
$ make findnewsplicesites
```

The *.jar libraries are not included in the main jar file, [so you shouldn't move them](https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/15#issuecomment-140099011 ).
The required libraries will be downloaded and installed in the `dist` directory.

Experimental: you can also create a [fat jar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150811/) which contains classes from all the libraries, on which your project depends (it's bigger). Those fat-jar are generated by adding `standalone=yes` to the gnu make command, for example ` make findnewsplicesites standalone=yes`.

### edit 'local.mk' (optional)

The a file **local.mk** can be created edited to override/add some definitions.

For example it can be used to set the HTTP proxy:

```
http.proxy.host=your.host.com
http.proxy.port=124567
```
